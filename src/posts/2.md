In my previous post I wrote and went over this code
```rs
#![allow(unused_variables)]
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]

use std::ops::Div;

struct add;

struct Partial(i32);

impl Div<add> for i32 {
    type Output = Partial;

    fn div(self, rhs: add) -> Self::Output {
        Partial(self)
    }
    
}

impl Div<i32> for Partial {
    type Output = i32;
    
    fn div(self, rhs: i32) -> Self::Output {
        self.0 + rhs
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 1 /add/ 2;
    println!("{x}"); // prints out: 3
}
```

although this is not very reusable and if we wanted to add another one it's certainly not DRY so let's make a macro to fix that. Firstly we're gonna want an idea of how calling the macro should look and then from there we can work backwards. We'll go with this as how our macro will be called:
```rs
infix!(add (a: i32, b: i32) => i32 {
    a + b
})
```

let's start with the `macro_rules!` definition
```rs
macro_rules! infix {
    ($z:ident ($x:ident: $t:ty, $y:ident: $yt:ty) => $ret:ty $e:block) => {
        // We will fill this in next
    }
}
```
now that we have all the `ident`s and types we need we can start with the nitty gritty implementation details
```rs
struct $z;

const _: () = {
    // snip
};
```
here `$z` is the name of our infix function
and the funky const is so that the partial struct doesnt leak outside the macro. Let's take a peak inside into the contents of the `const` block
```rs
const _: () = {
    struct Partial($t);
    
    impl ::std::ops::Div<$z> for $t {
        type Output = Partial;
        
        fn div(self, rhs: $z) -> Self::Output {
            Partial(self)
        }
    }

    impl ::std::ops::Div<$yt> for Partial {
        type Output = $ret;

        fn div(self, rhs: $yt) -> Self::Output {
            let $x = self.0;
            let $y = rhs;

            $e
        }
    }
};
```
as you can see, it's basically what we had before with the exception that our `1 + 2` expression is now replaced by a `$e` which is our block that we pass to the macro, all the funky `$x` variables are fragments, you can read up on them [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/macros-by-example.html).
