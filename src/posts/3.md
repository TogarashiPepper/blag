# 1. What are typestates?
I'm bad at explaining, so instead, read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typestate_analysis).

# 2. A simple drone
let's say you have a `Drone` type, like so
```rs
struct Drone {
    flying: bool,
    position: (u8, u8)
}

impl Drone {
    fn take_off(&mut self) {
        self.flying = true;
    }
    fn land(&mut self) {
        self.flying = false;
    }
    fn move_to(&mut self, x: u8, y: u8) {
        self.position = (x, y);
    }
}
```

and we can use it like this:
```rs
drone.take_off();
drone.move_to(5, 1);
drone.land();
```

but what happens if you try to `.move_to()` *after* the drone has landed?
```rs
drone.move_to(); // catastrophic failure
```
# 3. Typestates!
We will use typestates to check this at compile-time! But first, to accommodate for our newly found types, we will slightly modify our `Drone` type

```rs
struct Drone<T> {
    flying: bool,
    position: (u8, u8),
    _marker: std::marker::PhantomData<T> // make the compiler happy
}
```

and define some new `struct`s to help us keep track of the state

```rs
struct Flying;
struct Idle;
```

and we can now change our impl to look a little something like this

```rs
impl<T> Drone<T> {
    fn convert<U>(self) -> Drone<U> {
        Drone {
            flying: self.flying,
            position: self.position,
            _marker: std::marker::PhantomData::<U>
        }
    }
}

impl Drone<Flying> {
    fn land(mut self) -> Drone<Idle> {
        self.flying = false;

        self.convert()
    }
    fn move_to(&mut self, x: u8, y: u8) {
        self.position = (x, y);
    }
}

impl Drone<Idle> {
    fn take_off(mut self) -> Drone<Flying> {
        self.flying = true;

        self.convert()
    }
}
```
now each method is specific to the state the drone should be in so we can't do something like trying to move a drone that is `Idle`. Now now our previously incorrect program now fails to compile!

```rs
let mut drone: Drone<Idle> = Drone {
    flying: false,
    position: (0, 0),
    _marker: std::marker::PhantomData
};

let mut drone = drone.take_off();
drone.move_to(5, 1);
let mut drone = drone.land();
drone.move_to(0, 0); // error[E0599]: no method named `move_to` found for struct `Drone<Idle>` in the current scope
```

Although now our code now though is a little more complex because in order to make our type magic work we need to redeclare it after every operation that modifies the type.

# 4. Conclusion
Typestates are an interesting and useful way to ensure a piece of code is correct although the need to redeclare feels a bit cumbersome, there are probably better ways to do this but they're beyond me at the moment.
