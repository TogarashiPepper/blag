title: Poor man's infix functions
description: implementing infix functions using some Rust trickery

# 1. The How
We will use operator overloading to secretly call our glue that makes it all work, a finished product should look something like this

```rs
fn main() {
    let sum = 1 /add/ 2; // sum should be equal to 3
}
```

# 2. Implementing it
Firstly, we must create a struct `add`, we will do it like so

```rs
struct add;
```
notice how there are no fields to the struct, this is because we dont need any, we will use another struct called `Partial` to create a sort of [poor man's partial application](https://suneettipirneni.stream/posts/partial-application-at-home/).
Here's how we'll define `Partial`:
```rs
struct Partial(i32);
```

and here are the necessary `impl`'s to go along with our struct definitions
```rs
impl Div<add> for i32 {
    type Output = Partial;
    
    fn div(self, Rhs: add) -> Self::Output {
        Partial(self)
    }
    
}

impl Div<i32> for Partial {
    type Output = i32;
    
    fn div(self, Rhs: i32) -> Self::Output {
        self.0 + Rhs
    }
}
```

so our final product should look something like this

```rs
#![allow(unused_variables)]
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]

use std::ops::Div;

struct add;

struct Partial(i32);

impl Div<add> for i32 {
    type Output = Partial;

    fn div(self, rhs: add) -> Self::Output {
        Partial(self)
    }
    
}

impl Div<i32> for Partial {
    type Output = i32;
    
    fn div(self, rhs: i32) -> Self::Output {
        self.0 + rhs
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 1 /add/ 2;
    println!("{x}"); // prints out: 3
}
```

Alight so let's break this down step by step by manually expanding `1 /add/ 2`.
so `1 / add` gives us a `Partial(1)` and then `Partial(1) / 2` gives us `3`


# 3. The why
Why anyone would ever do this is beyond me although while not very useful it's an interesting use of a feature for a purpose it was not intended for and I love things like this and seeing this type of thing is what makes a fun mini-project to me.
